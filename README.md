# LuaSDB - Lua Simple Database

A simple, lightweight, file driven database system, in 100% LUA.
Resource can function entirely standalone so it should fit into any project that can see a purpose for it *(granted it wont be many..)*
Will run on CFX platforms *(RedM + FiveM)* if needed,internal functions will change slightly to use cfx native functions for loading and saving files.

**Note:** There are plenty of better alternatives (like SQLite), but this project was built mostly out of curiosity and boredom.

## Why Bother?
Just for fun mostly, sometimes the best reason to do anything is because we can right?
It was simply a side-project to play around with some LUA functionality outside of the space im used to, nothing more nothing less.

## Where Could I Use This?

- **FiveM / RedM Scripts**: Storing player data, inventories, bans, or whitelists without setting up a separate DB?  
- **Standalone Lua Apps**: Keeping config files, user profiles, or save data in plain Lua?  
- **Game Modding**: Games that embed Lua?
- **Lightweight Data Storage**: When you just need quick local data without SQL overhead?  
- **Embedded Systems**: Systems where you only need minimal structured data logs?  
- **Prototyping**: Quickly test out schema logic without setting up a full database server?  
- **Offline Storage**: Storing offline data in a structured format? 
- **Mock Databases**: Testing table schemas before production?

## Future Plans?
None set in stone! This project was more of a personal experiment than a product roadmap. 
If you find it helpful or have ideas, feel free to adapt it for your own needs or build upon it. 

# Dependencies

- None, LuaSDB is entirely standalone.

# Notes

- Currently documentation for LuaSDB is limited to the included `docs` files, these may be moved to gitbook in time however for now it will have to do.
